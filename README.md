# Text-Driven Emotion Detection 

Text-Driven Emotion Detection is a Data mining project developed as part of the IS-211 university course.  
The project focuses on analyzing text data to identify and classify the emotions expressed by users.  
By leveraging datasets from **Kaggle** and **Hugging Face**, we explore how emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, and others can be accurately detected from written text.

## What problem it solves  

In today’s digital world, a large amount of communication happens through text (social media posts, reviews, chats, emails).  
However, understanding the emotions behind the text is challenging for both individuals and organizations.  

- Companies struggle to gauge customer satisfaction from reviews.  
- Educators and psychologists need insights into students’ or patients’ emotional well-being.  
- Online platforms want to promote healthy discussions by detecting negative emotions early.  

Our project helps solve these problems by using AI to automatically detect emotions in text, providing valuable insights for decision-making, mental health awareness, and customer engagement.

## Objectives  

- To classify text into different emotion categories using machine learning models  
- To visualize findings using **Power BI** for better interpretation of results  
- To experiment with different tools (**Weka**, **Streamlit**, and **Colab**) to compare performance and usability

- **Development & Experiments**: Google Colab  
- **Modeling & Evaluation**: Weka, Streamlit  
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Data preprocessing**: Power BI

## Dataset  

We used datasets from **Kaggle** and **Hugging Face**, containing labeled text samples mapped to emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, love, surprise, and fear.  
These datasets were preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for building and evaluating models.

## Features  

- Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization using TF-IDF)  
- Training machine learning models on multiple datasets  
- Performance comparison across different models and tools  
- Interactive emotion detection demo built with **Streamlit**  
- Visualization of emotion distribution in **PowerBI** and evaluating model performance in **Weka**
